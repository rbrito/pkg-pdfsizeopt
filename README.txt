README for pdfsizeopt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
pdfsizeopt is a program for converting large PDF files to small ones. More
specifically, pdfsizeopt is a free, cross-platform command-line application
(for Linux, macOS, Windows and Unix) and a collection of best practices
to optimize the size of PDF files, with focus on PDFs created from TeX and
LaTeX documents. pdfsizeopt is written in Python, so it is a bit slow, but
it offloads some of the heavy work to its faster (C, C++ and Java)
dependencies. pdfsizeopt was developed on a Linux system, and it depends on
existing tools such as Python 2.4, Ghostscript 8.50, jbig2enc (optional),
sam2p, pngtopnm, pngout (optional), and the Multivalent PDF compressor
(optional) written in Java.

Installation instructions and usage on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no installer, you need to run some commands in the command line to
download and install. pdfsizeopt is a command-line only application, there
is no GUI.

To install pdfsizeopt on a Linux system (with architecture i386 or amd64),
open a terminal window and run these commands (without the leading `$'):

  $ mkdir ~/pdfsizeopt
  $ cd ~/pdfsizeopt
  $ wget -O pdfsizeopt_libexec_linux.tar.gz https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/releases/download/2017-01-24/pdfsizeopt_libexec_linux-v3.tar.gz
  $ tar xzvf pdfsizeopt_libexec_linux.tar.gz
  $ wget -O pdfsizeopt.single https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/master/pdfsizeopt.single
  $ chmod +x pdfsizeopt.single
  $ ln -s pdfsizeopt.single pdfsizeopt

To optimize a PDF, run the following command

  ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt input.pdf output.pdf

If the input PDF has many images or large images, pdfsizeopt can be very
slow. You can speed it up by disabling pngout, the slowest image optimization
method, like this:

  ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt --use-pngout=no input.pdf output.pdf

pdfsizeopt creates lots of temporary files (psotmp.*) in the output
directory, but it also cleans up after itself.

It's possible to optimize a PDF outside the current directory. To do that,
specify the pathname (including the directory name) in the command-line.

Please note that the commands above download all dependencies (including
Python and Ghostscript) as well. It's possible to install some of the
dependencies with your package manager, but these steps are considered
alternative and more complicated, and thus are not covered here.

Please note that pdfsizeopt works perfectly on any x86 and amd64 Linux
system. There is no restriction on the libc, Linux distribution etc. because
pdfsizeopt uses only its statically linked x86 executables, and it doesn't
use any external commands (other than pdfsizeopt, pdfsizeopt.single and
pdfsizeopt_libexec/*) on the system. pdfsizeopt also works perfectly on x86
FreeBSD systems with the Linux emulation layer enabled.

To avoid typing ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt, add "$HOME/pdfsizeopt" to your PATH
(probably in your ~/.bashrc), open a new terminal window, and the
command pdfsizeopt will work from any directory.

You can also put pdfsizeopt to a directory other than ~/pdfsizeopt , as you
like.

Installation instructions and usage on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no installer, you need to run some commands in the command line
(black Command Prompt window) to download and install. pdfsizeopt is a
command-line only application, there is no GUI.

Create folder C:\pdfsizeopt, download
https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/releases/download/2017-09-02w/pdfsizeopt_win32exec-v6.zip
, and extract its contents to the folder C:\pdfsizeopt, so that the file
C:\pdfsizeopt\pdfsizeopt.exe exists.

Download
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/master/pdfsizeopt.single
and save it to C:\pdfsizeopt, as C:\pdfsizeopt\pdfsizeopt.single .

To optimize a PDF, run the following command

  C:\pdfsizeopt\pdfsizeopt input.pdf output.pdf

in the command line, which is a black Command Prompt window, you can start
it by Start menu / Run / cmd.exe, or finding Command Prompt in the start
menu.

(Press Tab to get filename completion while typing.)

Since you have to type the input filename as a full pathname, it's
recommended to create a directory with a short name (e.g. C:\pdfs), and copy
the input PDF there first.

If the input PDF has many images or large images, pdfsizeopt can be very
slow. You can speed it up by disabling pngout, the slowest image optimization
method, like this:

  C:\pdfsizeopt\pdfsizeopt --use-pngout=no input.pdf output.pdf

To avoid typing C:\pdfsizeopt\pdfsizeopt, add C:\pdfsizeopt to (the end of)
the system PATH, open a new Command Prompt window, and the command
`pdfsizeopt' will work from any directory.

Depending on your environment, filenames with whitespace, double quotes or
accented characters may not work in the Windows version of pdfsizeopt. To
play it safe, make sure your input and output files have names with letters,
numbers, underscore (_), dash (-), dot (.) and plus (+). The backslash (\)
and the slash (/) are both OK as the directory separator.

You can also put pdfsizeopt to a directory other than C:\pdfsizeopt , but it
won't work if there is whitespace or there are accented characters in any of
the folder names.

Please note that pdfsizeopt works perfectly in Wine (tested with wine-1.2 on
Ubuntu Lucid and wine-1.6.2 on Ubuntu Trusty), but it's a bit slower than
running it natively (as a Linux or Unix program).

Installation instructions and usage on macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no installer, you need to run some commands in the command line to
download and install. pdfsizeopt is a command-line only application, there
is no GUI.

To install pdfsizeopt on a macOS system (with architecture i386 or amd64),
open a terminal window and run these commands (without the leading `$'):

  $ mkdir ~/pdfsizeopt
  $ cd ~/pdfsizeopt
  $ curl -L -o pdfsizeopt_libexec_darwin.tar.gz https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/releases/download/2017-09-03d/pdfsizeopt_libexec_darwin-v1.tar.gz
  $ tar xzvf pdfsizeopt_libexec_darwin.tar.gz
  $ curl -L -o pdfsizeopt.single https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/master/pdfsizeopt.single
  $ chmod +x pdfsizeopt.single
  $ ln -s pdfsizeopt.single pdfsizeopt

Do a test optimization run, which exercises all dependencies of pdfsizeopt:

  $ curl -L -o deptest.pdf https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/raw/master/deptest/deptest.pdf
  $ ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt deptest.pdf

... and open (view) deptest.pdf and the corresponding optimized
deptest.pso.pdf .

To optimize a PDF, run the following command

  ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt input.pdf output.pdf

If the input PDF has many images or large images, pdfsizeopt can be very
slow. You can speed it up by disabling pngout, the slowest image optimization
method, like this:

  ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt --use-pngout=no input.pdf output.pdf

Also, if you have an 32-bit Mac, then the pngout bundled with pdfsizeopt
won't work (because it needs a 64-bit Mac), so you have to force
--use-pngout=no . See the section ``Image optimizers'' for alternatives of
pngout.

pdfsizeopt creates lots of temporary files (psotmp.*) in the output
directory, but it also cleans up after itself.

It's possible to optimize a PDF outside the current directory. To do that,
specify the pathname (including the directory name) in the command-line.

Please note that the commands above download most dependencies (including
Ghostscript, but excluding Python) as well. Everything should work as
instructed above, out of the box. If you are experiencing problems, please
report an issue on https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/issues .

To avoid typing ~/pdfsizeopt/pdfsizeopt, add "$HOME/pdfsizeopt" to your PATH
(probably in your ~/.bashrc), open a new terminal window, and the
command pdfsizeopt will work from any directory.

You can also put pdfsizeopt to a directory other than ~/pdfsizeopt , as you
like.

Installation instructions and usage on FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no installer, you need to run some commands in the command line to
download and install. pdfsizeopt is a command-line only application, there
is no GUI.

pdfsizeopt works perfectly on x86 FreeBSD systems with the Linux
emulation layer enabled. So, enable the Linux emulation layer on your
FreeBSD system, and then follow the
``Installation instructions and usage on Linux''.

Alterantively, you can follow the
``Installation instructions and usage on generic Unix'', but that needs much
more work on your part (and it's inconvenient and error-prone), because you
need to install many dependencies separately, possibly compiling some of
them from source.

Installation instructions and usage on generic Unix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no installer, you need to run some commands in the command line
(black Command Prompt window) to download and install. pdfsizeopt is a
command-line only application, there is no GUI.

pdfizeopt is a Python script. It works with Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7
(but it doesn't work with Python 3.x). So please install Python first.

Create a new directory named pdfsizeopt, and download this link there:

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/master/pdfsizeopt.single

Rename it to pdfsizeopt and make it executable by running the following
commands (without the leading `$'):

  $ cd pdfsizeopt
  $ mv pdfsizeopt.single pdfsizeopt
  $ chmod +x pdfsizeopt

If your Python executable is not /usr/bin/python, then edit the first line
(starting with `#!') in the pdfsizeopt script accordingly.

Try it with:

  $ ./pdfsizeopt --version
  info: This is pdfsizeopt ZIP rUNKNOWN size=105366.

pdfsizeopt has many dependencies. For full functionality, you need all of
them. Install all of them and put them to the PATH.

Dependencies:

* Python (command: python). Version 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 work (3.x doesn't
  work).
* Ghostscript (command: gs): Version 9 or newer should work.
* jbig2 (command: jbig2): Install from source:
  https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt-jbig2
  If you are unable to install, use pdfsizeopt --use-jbig2=no .
* pngout (command: pngout): Download binaries from here:
  http://www.jonof.id.au/kenutils Source code is not available.
  If you are unable to install, use pdfsizeopt --use-pngout=no .
* png22pnm (command: png22pnm): Install from source:
  https://github.com/pts/tif22pnm
  This is required by sam2p to open PNG files.
  Please note that the bundled tif22pnm command is not needed.
* sam2p (command: sam2p): Install from source:
  https://github.com/pts/sam2p
  If you are unable to install, use pdfsizeopt --do-optimize-images=no .
  Some Linux distributions have sam2p binaries, but they tend to be too old.
  Please use version >=0.49.3.

After installation, use pdfsizeopt as:

  $ ./pdfsizeopt input.pdf output.pdf

You can add the directory containing pdfsizeopt to the PATH, so the
command `pdfsizeopt' will work from any directory.

Image optimizers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pdfsizeopt can use the following external tools to make images in embedded
PDF files smaller:

* sam2p (used by default, cannot be disabled)
* jbig2 (used by default, disable with --use-jbgi2=no)
* pngout (used by default, disable with --use-pngout=no)
* zopflipng (not enabled by default)
* optipng (not enabled by default)
* advpng (not enabled by default)
* ECT (not enabled by default)

To enable or disable any image optimizer, specify all image optimizers you
want to be enabled like this: --use-image-optimizer=optipng,jbig2 . This
will also disable the default pngout.

You can also specify custom image optimizer command patterns by specifying
separate, additional --use-image-optimier= flags, like this:

  --use-image-optimizer="optipng %(sourcefnq)s -o6 -fix -force %(optipng_gray_flags)s-out %(targetfnq)s"

You always have to specify %(targetfnq) in the command pattern.

Specify --do-debug-image-optimizers=yes to see which image optimizers are
enabled (and their full command-line) for the current run.

At startup, pdfsizeopt checks that the requested image optimizers are
available (as program files), and fails if some of them are missing. To
ignore those which are missing, specify --do-require-image-optimizers=no .

It's your (the user's) responsibility to install the image optimizers and
add them to the PATH. If you follow the installation instructions for
Windows and Linux above, the default image optimizers (sam2p, jbig2 and
pngout) will be installed for you.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. pdfsizeopt fails for some fonts.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Specify --do-unify-fonts=no and --do-regenerate-all-fonts=no .

If it still fails, specify -do-optimize-fonts=no .

In either case, please report it on https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/issues

2. pdfsizeopt fails for some images.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Specify --do-optimize-images=no .

Please report it on https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/issues

3. pdfsizeopt is too slow processing images.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Specify --use-pngout=no . This disables pngout, which is the slowest
optimization step for images.

4. pdfsizeopt fails without creating the output PDF.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Please report it on https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/issues , attaching the
input PDF file and the console output of pdfsizeopt. Your report is very
much appreciated.

If pdfsizeopt exits with an uncaught exception, it may leave some temporary
files (psotmp.*) behind in the current directory. You can remove these files.

Please note that pdfsizeopt is not resilient in processing corrupt PDF
files (i.e. those which are not compliant to the PDF standard). So if
pdfsizeopt fails, then the reason may be a bug in pdfsizeopt or a corrupt
PDF input file. Nevertheless, please report an issue (see above).

5. The output PDF of pdfsizeopt doesn't look like the same as the input PDF.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Please report it on https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt/issues , attaching the
input PDF file and the output PDF file (.pso.pdf) and the console output of
pdfsizeopt. Your report is very much appreciated.

6. pdfsizeopt is unable to find some input files on Windows.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This may happen if the filename or the full pathname contains any character
other than the ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_),
ASCII dash (-), plus (+), dot (.), backslash (\) or slash (/). Typically
these characters don't work:

* spaces and tabs: This is easy to fix, just wrap the filename in double
  quotes ("), the usual way.
* double quotes ("): This can't happen, filenames on Windows are not allowed
  to contain double quotes. If you need to pass a non-filename argument with
  a double quote in it to pdfsizeopt, do this. Wrap the filename in double
  quotes ("), replace all double quotes (") with \", and replace a sequence
  backslashes (\) and an double quote (") immediately following them by
  duplicating the backslashes and replacing the double quote (") with \".
  This sounds complicated, but this is the usual way for other programs as
  well, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/4094897/97248 .
* newlines and other non-space and non-tab whitespace: This won't
  work, the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) doesn't allow these characters in
  command-line arguments.
* accented characters (such as á and ő). These characters won't work (or it
  may work for only some characters, depending on the active code page) in
  the PDF filename specified in the commandline, or in the full pathname of
  pdfsizeopt (so don't install pdfsizeopt to C:\bőr, it won't work).

  Accented characters (outside the active code page) will not work in the full pathname of
  pdfsizeopt (such as C:\bőr\pdfsizeopt.exe). That's because Python is
  unable to call external programs (os.system, os.popen, os.spawnl and
  subprocess.call) with accented characters in their name, because it uses
  the single-byte API.

* anything which is not ASCII printable (code between 33 and 126,
  inclusive): If not covered above, this may not work. See the description
  of accented characters.

If some filenames still don't work, the workarounds are:

* renaming or copying the file (and folders) in Windows Explorer, and passing
  the renamed file to pdfsizeopt
* using pdfsizeopt on a Unix system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, macOS) instead

Accented characters in PDF filename could be made work the following way (as
a future improvement work to pdfsizeopt):

* pdfsizeopt.exe should call the 16-bit API (GetCommandLineW) instead of
  the single-byte API (GetCommandLineA) to get the arguments
* pdfsizeopt.exe should escape the non-ASCII characters in the arguments
  (e.g. as U+12AB)
* pdfsizeopt.exe should run pdfsizeopt.single like this:

    ../pdfsizeopt_win32exec/pdfsizeopt_python.exe .../pdfsizeopt.single --args-u+ ...

* pdfsizeopt Python code should recognize --args-u+, and when finding the
  filename, it should convert it to unicode (by keeping ASCII except for
  U+12AB), and it should pass tha unicode-typed value to open(...). Such an
  open works in Python 2.6 on Windows.
* When displaying filenames, pdfsizeopt Python code should still display the
  ASCII with the U+12AB escaping. Thus the win32console module is not
  needed. Thus filenames will be displayed leglibly but incorrectly (not
  copy-pasteably) in the Command Prompt window.

* No escaping is needed in command lines of helper programs (e.g. gs,
  sam2p), because it's all ASCII, because filenames are autogenerated
  temporary fil names, which are all ASCII, and path to pdfsizeopt itself
  is required to the ASCII.

Accented characters in the pathname of pdfsizeopt.single can be made work
this way:

* Do the accented characters in the filename above first.
* pdfsizeopt.exe should use wgetcwd to get the current directory.
* pdfsizeopt.exe should use wchdir to change to the directory of
  pdfsizeopt.single .
* pdfsizeopt.exe should prepend the directories pdfsizeopt_win32exec and
  pdfsizeopt_win32exec/pdfsizeopt_gswin to the PATH, using wputenv.
* pdfsizeopt.exe should run pdfsizeopt.single like this:

    pdfsizeopt_python.exe pdfsizeopt.single --args-u+ --cwd=... ...

  , where the value of --cwd= is the escaped (U+12AB) verwion of the
  result of wgetcwd.

* pdfsizeopt Python code should prepend the value of --cwd=... to the input
  filename if it's relative.
* pdfsizeopt Python code shouldn't modify the PATH if --cwd=... is present.
  (Does this environment variable propagation work in Python 2.6.? Let's try!)
* It's still true that
  no escaping is needed in command lines of external programs (e.g. gs,
  sam2p), because it's all ASCII, because temporary file names are all ASCII,
  and path to pdfsizeopt itself is required to the ASCII.

7. Error on Windows: The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000034). Click on OK to terminate the application.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This error has happened on a Windows XP system. The solution: download
msvcr90.dll (or find it somewhere already on your system), and copy it into
pdfsizeopt_win32exec (next to python26.dll). Any version of msvcr90.dll will
work:

* msvcr90.dll 9.0.21022.8 (655872 bytes)
* msvcr90.dll 9.0.30729.6161 (653136 bytes)
* msvcr90.dll 9.0.30729.9247 (653968 bytes)

8. Error on Windows: The system cannot execute the specified command.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This error has happened on a Windows XP system when the file
Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest was missing from the pdfsizeopt_win32exec
directory. The solution: reinstall pdfsieopt, the directory
pdfsizeopt_win32exec in the newest version has that file.
